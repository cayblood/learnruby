software that will help the selection committee select the best
presentations from those submitted.  Each member of the selection
committee will rate the presentations from 1 to 5.

ASSIGNMENT

For this assignment,

(1) Create a Presentation Class.  It should:

    (a) Have a title
    (b) Have the name of the presentor
    (c) Be able to add scores from the selection committee.  Scores
        will be an integer from 1 to 5.
