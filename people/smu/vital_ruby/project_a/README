PROJECT A -- Conference Scheduling
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Given:

  (1) a set of presentations (in the same format as the
      "presentations.txt" file from lab 4) and

  (2) A number of time slots

  (3) A number of tracks

Write a program that will assign presentations to a track and a time
slot so that:

  (A) No individual speaker is assigned more than once to a time slot.

  (B) The number of different categories in a single time slot is
      maximized.  (i.e.  If there are a number of iPhone talks, put
      them in different time slots so that an attendee mainly
      interested in iPhone development can see as many talks as
      possible)
