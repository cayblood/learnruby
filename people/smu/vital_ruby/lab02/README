LAB 2 -- Wondrous Numbers Sequence
----------------------------------------------------------------------

ASSIGNMENT - Part 1
-------------------

Write a function that tacks a positive integer n and returns the
wondrous sequence for n.

Examples:

   wondrous_sequence(5)  # => [5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1]

ASSIGNMENT - Part 2
-------------------

Suppose we are asked to calculate the wondrous sequence for 5, we
would get [5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1].  Now suppose we are asked for the
wondrous sequence for 10.  After the first step we get 5, but we
already know the value of 5's sequence (since we just got done
calculating it).

Write an optimized version of wondrous_sequence that remembers prior
calls and uses that to avoid generating the entire sequence from
scratch.

HINT: Perhaps a global Hash (maybe called CACHE) would be helpful.
