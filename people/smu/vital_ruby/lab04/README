Format for "votes.txt"

Each line in this file is a score, assigned by one of the selection
committee memebers for a single presentation.  Each line consists of
two numbers.  The first is the numeric ID for the presentation.  The
second number is the score (from 1 to 5) for that particular
presentation.  

Examples:

16 4
3 4
16 1

The above represents presentation number 16 getting a score of 4,
presentation number 3 getting a score of 4, and presentation number 16
getting a score of 1.  Notice that any given presentation may get
several scores.
