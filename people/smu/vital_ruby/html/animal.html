        <h1>Project C: Animal Quiz</h1>

<p>(from <a href="http://www.rubyquiz.com/quiz15.html">Ruby Quiz #15</a>)</p>

<p>Write a program that attempts to guess an animal.</p>

<p>It works like this. The program starts by telling the user to think of
an animal. It then begins asking a series of yes/no questions about
that animal: does it swim, does it have hair, etc. Eventually, it will
narrow down the possibilities to a single animal and guess that (Is it
a mouse?).</p>

<p>If the program has guessed correctly, the game is over and may be
restarted with a new animal. If the program has guess incorrectly, it
asks the user for the kind of animal they were thinking of and then
asks for the user to provide a question that can distinguish between
its incorrect guess and the correct answer. It then adds the new
question and animal to its "database" and will guess that animal in
the future (if appropriate).</p>

<p>Here's an example run:</p>

<hr />

<pre>
Is it a mouse? n
Rats, I lose
Help me play better next time.
What animal were you thinking of? dolphin
Give me a question to distinguish a a mouse from a dolphin. is it aquatic?
For a dolphin, the answer to your question would be? y
Thank you

Play again? y


Is it aquatic? y
Is it a dolphin? n
Rats, I lose
Help me play better next time.
What animal were you thinking of? shark
Give me a question to distinguish a a dolphin from a shark. is it a mammal
For a shark, the answer to your question would be? n
Thank you

Play again? y


Is it aquatic? n
Is it a mouse? n
Rats, I lose
Help me play better next time.
What animal were you thinking of? elephant
Give me a question to distinguish a a mouse from an elephant. Is it a large animal
For an elephant, the answer to your question would be? y
Thank you

Play again? y


Is it aquatic? n
Is it a large animal? n
Is it a mouse? y
Yea! I win!

Play again? n

<h4>Hint -- Possible Solution (click to view)</h4>

<div class="solution">

<p>There is an easy solution that represents the database as a binary
tree with questions as interior nodes and possible animals as leaf
nodes. Each interior question node has two children corresponding to a
yes or no answer. The children are either further questions (which
will be asked) or an animal (which will be guessed).</p>

</div>

<h4>Hint -- Code Snippets for Storing the Animal DB (click to view)</h4>

<div class="solution">

<p>If you wish to store your database of animals and questions in an
external file to be reused between runs, the YAML library can easily
do this.  Suppose your database is in an object called ... animals.
To save your database, do:</p>

<pre><code>require 'yaml'

open("database.yml", "w") do |f|
  f.write(animals.to_yaml)
end
</code></pre>

<p>To load up a previously saved animal database, do:</p>

<pre><code>require 'yaml'

animals = YAML.load_file("database.yml")
</code></pre>

</div>
