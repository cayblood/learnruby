LAB 1 -- Wondrous Numbers
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Consider the following rule for a number n:

  If n is even, then divide it by 2.
  If n is odd, then multiply it by 3 and add 1.

By repeating the rule over and over, you can generate a sequence of
numbers using the given rule.  Stop if the sequence reaches 1.

For example, starting with 5:

  5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1

Another example, staring with 7:

  7, 22, 11, 34, 17, 52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1

Wondrous numbers will generate a sequence that eventually ends with 1.

ASSIGNMENT
----------

For this assignment,

(1) Write a function wondrous?(n) that takes a positive integer n and
    returns true if the number is wondrous, and false if it is
    not-wondrous.

(2) Write some top level code that reads a number from standard input,
    calls wondrous?(n) and displays the results.
